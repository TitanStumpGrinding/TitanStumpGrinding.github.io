<p style="text-align:center;"><b>About Titan: The Local Family Business</b></br>
I have been working on websites for more than 15 years, beginning with HTML custom coding as a hobby as a young kid. I have always enjoyed the ability to change a web page and see the results instantly, whether you broke the page or ended up with the desired result, it always led to being able to see a vision come to life. This grew quickly into the natural progression of working with business owners to place their web pages higher in the rankings as search engines became more prominent in the early 2000's. To this day I still work with my original client to maintain his local positioning for his business in Tacoma, WA. This what I enjoy doing - helping others while leveraging my love for technology and the internet.</p>
